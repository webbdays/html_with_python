# About :
* Write/Create html documents with Python.


# Implementation :
* Every tag is treated as python object.
* Each tag object has inner list to store tags inside it.
* html document is created with depth_traversal of the starting from html tag.
* html string is returned if needed.

# Starting point for this project :
* I wish to make some project in Python.
* Can we write/create html documents such that it is programmable/programmer friendly?
* Also good syntax is needed, so I started with Python for implementation.
